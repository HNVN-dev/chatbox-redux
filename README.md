# Chatbox Redux

Simple project where I'm trying to figure out how to run a provider using the websocket protocol. Using dependency inversion.

For this exercise, I've thought of coding a chatbox that will also allow me to tackle interesting points such as viewmodel testing and store normalization.

## Dependencies

I used my starter which is here (https://github.com/HNVN-dev/react-redux-clean-archi) for this project.

## Notes

Perhaps you'll find that using redux isn't really necessary in this case.

That's not a point I'd defend. This project exists solely to satisfy my desire to know how - properly - to use redux with a websocket provider and how to do it in TDD.
